## COMPONENTS

To speed up the time it takes you to solve these tasks we have provided several components that will help you style and structure the user interface.

These components are based on the styled-system specification and rendered using styled-components.


### Box

The Box component serves as a wrapper component for layout related needs. Use Box to set values such as display, width, height, and more. In practice, this component is used as a wrapper around other components to achieve Box Model related styling.

This component uses the following functions from the styled-system: background, border, color, flexbox, layout, position, shadow, and space.

Reference table for styled-system: [https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system/blob/master/docs/table.md](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system/blob/master/docs/table.md)

We recommend to use long-hand properties, for example:

```js
// Do
<Box borderTopWidth="sm" borderTopColor="border" borderTopStyle="solid" />
// Don't
<Box borderTop="1px solid" borderColor="border" />
```

### Flex

The Flex component behaves the same as the Box component except that it has display: flex set by default.


### List

The List component renders a ul element with list-style-type: none set by default.

This component uses the following functions from styled-system: layout, space.

### ListItem

The ListItem component renders a li element, and it's recommended to be used as the children of the List component.


### Text

The Text component is a wrapper component that will apply typography styles to the text inside. It renders a div element as default, but using the ["as" polyphormic property from the styled-components specification](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#as-polymorphic-prop) can render any text element, such as p, h1, span, etc.


### Button

The Button component can use two different variants; primary and secondary, that can be manipulated through the variant property.

This component uses the following functions from styled-system: layout, space.
